    "## Experimental Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will take another look at experimental design, in particular you will come up with a testing strategy for COVID-19 that tests the entire population of a state with a limited testing budget by pooling samples from the population. This can also be interpreted as a type of resource allocation problem. We would like to use the limited amount of tests that we have to test as many people as possible in a timely fashion.\n",

    "### RT-PCR Testing for COVID-19\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main tests used for COVID-19 diagnostic is the RT-PCR test which quantifies the amount of viral RNA, typically from a nasal or throat swab. In a nutshell the genetic information of the virus is reversely transcribed (RT) into DNA which is then multiplied via a chain reaction (PCR) to make it detectable. \n",

    "\n",
    "One feature of this type of test is that one can pool multiple swabs into a single sample which then gets analyzed. In this exercise we will aim to exploit this fact to design a near-optimal testing strategy."
